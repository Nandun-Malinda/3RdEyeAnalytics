                    A good data visualisation is all about telling a story – visually. It involves not only understanding the data itself, but why it is important to a user. Defining a context for the data is the first step in the design process, understanding what meaning it imparts to a user, what insights a user will derive from a clearer picture. Adding interactivity to a visualization requires a deeper understanding of why the story is important to the user and what questions and explore the user may want to do as a result of their initial insights.

                    At 3RD Eye Analytics data visualisation design process starts with understanding clients’ requirements, analysis of the data, and mutually defining the context for the data. We then design wireframes of a few different concepts to help get consensus on an approach. This is then followed up with a rough mock-up, and final pixel perfect renderings that can be used as design guideline for a software development effort, or in some cases as a final product themselves.
